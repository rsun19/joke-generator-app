# joke-generator-app

A nice and nifty iMessage Extension using Swift. It calls the API on my Flask server and fetches jokes based on the query.

A few guidelines if you do decide to clone this app.
- DO NOT deploy to production. This is for PERSONAL/RESEARCH USE ONLY. The copyright issues regarding the jokes is a bit complicated lets just say...

- The API is for LIMITED CALLS ONLY. DO NOT MAKE MORE THAN A FEW CALLS PER DAY. My server probably will not be able to handle the load. Please make your own API if you want to make a joke generator. If you want to use my joke generator specifically, please refer to these offical channels:
1. [website](https://robertssun.me/jokegenerator/)
2. [beta test](https://testflight.apple.com/join/DHtgfi6C)

- The API calls are on an honor system (read above guidelines). If I find that it has been abused, I will implement authentication headers and allow no one to access it... Don't ruin it for everyone.

- Please contact me if you want a joke taken down (if and only if you can prove that you've authored it). Email: robertssun1234 `<at>` gmail `<dot>` com.

- Happy hacking!
